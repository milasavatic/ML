ML — Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a machine learning project.

## Titanic Project

A classic ML exercise - predicting survival on the Titanic using common data science techniques (data cleaning, feature engineering, model training).

## Notebook Overview

ML_Lab5.ipynb covers:

- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling)
- Implementing machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, etc.)
- Model training and evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, cross-validation)
- Visualization of data and model performance

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy / Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
